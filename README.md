To play my version of Tic Tac Toe please visit cmansour.bitballoon.com
Unsolved issue includes the mobile version of my website. The table which holds the cells of the game will move around if the window shrinks too small. Also, when the game is reset, if the player to reset the game is player 2 then the next game will start with player 2's move.
